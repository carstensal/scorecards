# Shiny tool for Scorecard development
Simplified toolkit for scorecard development. 

Idea behind app was to combine usual scorecard development tools into single interactive tool and keep it as open source project, since this purely started as sideline project. Scorecard development fundamentally isn't that difficult and should take so long, or cost so much to support, potential to free up some funds for companies stuck with SAS. 

App development drew heavily from following sources:
* https://github.com/grabear/awesome-rshiny
* https://sites.google.com/site/shinyscorecards/

* https://community.rstudio.com/t/shiny-contest-submission-build-credit-risk-scorecards/24798
* https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Sharma-CreditScoring.pdf
* and obviously Naeem Siddiqi's books which are to scorecard development
